Note: technically speaking a map of 5 x 5 can only have coordinates from (0, 0) to (4, 4),
	but according to test input, in order to get desired result, the rover must
	be able to access points (0, y) and (5, y).
	Therefore I assume the valid coordinates on the map is from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
	for a 5 x 5 map

- rover-console.js:
	- js file that takes input as described in the test file.
	- File usage: node rover-console.js < testcmd

- rover.js
- rover.css
- rover.html
	- open rover.html for a GUI for the Rover
